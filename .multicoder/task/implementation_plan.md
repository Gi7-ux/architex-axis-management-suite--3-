## Implementation Plan: MySQL Database Integration

This plan outlines the steps to integrate a MySQL database into the project and implement the necessary backend and frontend functionality, considering the constraints of a shared cPanel hosting environment with PHP and JS support and no terminal access.

1.  **Design Database Schema:** Define the structure of the database, including tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints based on the application's data requirements.
2.  **Implement Database Connection in PHP:** Create a PHP script (`backend/db_connect.php`) to establish a secure connection to the MySQL database using the provided credentials.
3.  **Implement Backend API Endpoints (PHP):** Develop PHP scripts (e.g., `backend/api.php`) to handle API requests for various actions (e.g., CRUD operations for users, projects, etc.). These scripts will interact with the database.
4.  **Update Frontend API Service (JavaScript):** Create or modify a JavaScript service (`src/apiService.ts` or a new file) on the frontend to make asynchronous requests to the PHP backend API using `fetch` or a similar library.
5.  **Integrate Frontend Components (React):** Update existing or create new React components to fetch, display, and manipulate data using the frontend API service.
6.  **Configure Database Credentials:** Explain how to configure the database credentials in the PHP connection file (`backend/db_connect.php`).
