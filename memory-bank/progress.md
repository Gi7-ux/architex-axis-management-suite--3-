# Progress: Architex Axis Management Suite

## Current Date: 2025-06-24

## 1. What Works

* **Frontend Application:** The React frontend is now in a stable state after resolving all merge conflicts. All components have been updated to use the latest `AuthContext` and `apiService` definitions.
* **PHP Backend Core:**
  * `backend/db_connect.php`: Connects to MySQL and now supports environment variables.
  * `backend/api.php`: Basic routing, CORS headers, and JWT integration are in place.
  * `backend/composer.json`: Correctly configured for dependencies and autoloading.
* **Project Configuration for cPanel (Phase 1 Complete):**
  * `public_html` directory created.
  * `vite.config.ts` updated to build into `public_html/dist` and includes `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
  * `.htaccess` file created in `public_html` for SPA routing and backend access.
* **Database Schema (Presumed):** As initial state.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Implement (Current Task: PHP Backend Migration)

* **Full PHP API Implementation:**
  * Develop all required API endpoints in `backend/api.php` to cover functionalities listed in `apiService.ts`. This includes:
    * User management (CRUD operations for users).
    * Project management (CRUD, status updates, archiving).
    * Application management (submitting, accepting applications).
    * Job card management (CRUD, status updates).
    * Time log management.
    * File management (upload, download, delete).
    * Messaging (fetching conversations, messages, sending messages).
    * Dashboard statistics.
    * Skills and reports.
* **Frontend API Integration:**
  * Modify `apiService.ts` to change `API_BASE_URL` to point to `/backend/api.php`.
  * Update all API call functions in `apiService.ts` to use the `?action=` query parameter format.
  * Implement JWT handling in the frontend (storing token on login, sending with requests, clearing on logout).
* **PHP Backend Enhancements:**
  * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.
  * Ensure all database queries use prepared statements.
* **Deployment to cPanel:**
  * Upload built frontend assets and backend PHP files to the cPanel server.
  * Configure database connection on cPanel if different from local.
  * Thoroughly test all functionalities in the live cPanel environment.

## 3. Current Status

* **Phase 0: Planning & Documentation (Complete)**
* **Phase 1: Project Restructuring and Configuration (Complete)**
* **Phase 2: Backend Development (PHP) (In Progress)**
  * **Merge Conflicts Resolved:** All merge conflicts have been resolved, and the codebase is now stable.
  * **TypeScript Errors Fixed:** All TypeScript errors have been resolved.
  * **Memory Bank Updated:** All memory bank files have been updated to reflect the current state of the project.
* **Phase 3: Frontend Development (React) (Not Started)**
* **Phase 4: Deployment and Testing (Not Started)**

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

* The full extent of API endpoints required by the frontend needs to be meticulously mapped from `apiService.ts` to PHP implementations.
* Local PHP development environment needs to be set up or confirmed to mirror cPanel capabilities closely (PHP version, extensions).
* The placeholder `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in `backend/config.php` must be changed to a strong, unique secret and stored securely before any production deployment.
* The `createUser` endpoint is currently public; its security implications (e.g., rate limiting, CAPTCHA) should be considered for a production environment.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

* **Initial Decision:** Migrate the existing React frontend to a PHP backend for cPanel deployment.
* **Documentation Strategy:** Adopt the Memory Bank system for comprehensive project documentation from the outset.

## [2025-06-24] - Codebase Analysis and Memory Bank Synchronization

* **Task:** A full analysis of the current codebase was initiated to synchronize the memory bank with the project's actual state.
* **Action:** A `project-research` agent performed a high-level analysis of the architecture, technology stack, directory structure, and key configuration files.
* **Result:** The analysis provided a detailed and up-to-date overview of the project.
* **Status:** **Complete**. The memory bank has been fully updated with the findings from the analysis. `systemPatterns.md` was rewritten, and all other relevant files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `changelog.md`) were appended with new information. The memory bank is now synchronized with the current state of the codebase.
