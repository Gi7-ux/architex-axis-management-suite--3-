# Progress: Architex Axis Management Suite

## Current Date: 2025-06-26

## 1. What Works

* **Frontend Application:** The React frontend is now in a stable state after resolving all merge conflicts. All components have been updated to use the latest `AuthContext` and `apiService` definitions.
* **PHP Backend Core:**
  * `backend/db_connect.php`: Connects to MySQL and now supports environment variables.
  * `backend/api.php`: Basic routing, CORS headers, and JWT integration are in place.
  * `backend/composer.json`: Correctly configured for dependencies and autoloading.
* **Project Configuration for cPanel (Phase 1 Complete):**
  * `public_html` directory created.
  * `vite.config.ts` updated to build into `public_html/dist` and includes `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
  * `.htaccess` file created in `public_html` for SPA routing and backend access.
* **Development Environment Improvements:**
  * `jest.setup.js`: Updated to properly handle TextEncoder/TextDecoder and add window.matchMedia mocks.
  * `vite.config.ts`: Fixed path resolution, particularly for context importing.
  * `package.json`: Added missing dependency identity-obj-proxy for CSS/asset imports in tests.
* **Comprehensive Debugging and Testing Infrastructure:**
  * Created `tests/integration/PHPBackendIntegration.test.ts` - Full backend API testing suite
  * Created `tests/integration/FrontendPHPIntegration.test.tsx` - Frontend-backend integration tests
  * Created `tests-e2e/integration/full-stack-integration.spec.ts` - End-to-end workflow testing
  * Created `backend/tests/IntegrationTest.php` - PHP backend unit and integration tests
  * Created comprehensive VS Code debugging configurations (`.vscode/launch.json`)
  * Created automated test runners (`test-runner.sh` and `test-runner.bat`)
  * Created detailed debugging guide (`DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`)
  * Updated package.json with comprehensive test scripts
* **Development Environment Improvements:**
  * `jest.setup.js`: Updated to properly handle TextEncoder/TextDecoder and add window.matchMedia mocks.
  * `vite.config.ts`: Fixed path resolution, particularly for context importing.
  * `package.json`: Added missing dependency identity-obj-proxy for CSS/asset imports in tests.
  * Created `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Comprehensive guide for resolving common development issues.
* **MCP Debugging Automation Tool:**
  * Created comprehensive MCP server (`mcp-tools/debug-automation/`) that automates debugging setup.
  * Includes tools for: setup_debug_environment, create_debug_guide, validate_debug_setup.
  * Automatically configures VS Code launch.json, tasks.json, and settings.json for full-stack debugging.
  * Generates comprehensive DEBUG_GUIDE.md with breakpoint strategies and troubleshooting.
  * Supports PHP Xdebug, React Chrome debugging, and Jest test debugging configurations.
* **Database Schema (Presumed):** As initial state.

[2025-06-26] - Implemented comprehensive debugging and testing infrastructure alongside previous development environment improvements.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Implement (Current Task: PHP Backend Migration)

* **Development Environment Issues Resolution:**
  * Fix Jest test execution to properly output results and run tests successfully.
  * Resolve issues with running Vite development server.
  * Ensure all tests pass before continuing with backend development.

* **Full PHP API Implementation:**
  * Develop all required API endpoints in `backend/api.php` to cover functionalities listed in `apiService.ts`. This includes:
    * User management (CRUD operations for users).
    * Project management (CRUD, status updates, archiving).
    * Application management (submitting, accepting applications).
    * Job card management (CRUD, status updates).
    * Time log management.
    * File management (upload, download, delete).
    * Messaging (fetching conversations, messages, sending messages).
    * Dashboard statistics.
    * Skills and reports.
    
[2025-06-26] - Added development environment issues resolution as a priority task.
* **Frontend API Integration:**
  * Modify `apiService.ts` to change `API_BASE_URL` to point to `/backend/api.php`.
  * Update all API call functions in `apiService.ts` to use the `?action=` query parameter format.
  * Implement JWT handling in the frontend (storing token on login, sending with requests, clearing on logout).
* **PHP Backend Enhancements:**
  * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.
  * Ensure all database queries use prepared statements.
* **Deployment to cPanel:**
  * Upload built frontend assets and backend PHP files to the cPanel server.
  * Configure database connection on cPanel if different from local.
  * Thoroughly test all functionalities in the live cPanel environment.

## 3. Current Status

* **Phase 0: Planning & Documentation (Complete)**
* **Phase 1: Project Restructuring and Configuration (Complete)**
* **Phase 2: Backend Development (PHP) (In Progress)**
  * **Merge Conflicts Resolved:** All merge conflicts have been resolved, and the codebase is now stable.
  * **TypeScript Errors Fixed:** All TypeScript errors have been resolved.
  * **Memory Bank Updated:** All memory bank files have been updated to reflect the current state of the project.
* **Phase 3: Frontend Development (React) (Not Started)**
* **Phase 4: Deployment and Testing (Not Started)**

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

* The full extent of API endpoints required by the frontend needs to be meticulously mapped from `apiService.ts` to PHP implementations.
* Local PHP development environment needs to be set up or confirmed to mirror cPanel capabilities closely (PHP version, extensions).
* The placeholder `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in `backend/config.php` must be changed to a strong, unique secret and stored securely before any production deployment.
* The `createUser` endpoint is currently public; its security implications (e.g., rate limiting, CAPTCHA) should be considered for a production environment.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

* **Initial Decision:** Migrate the existing React frontend to a PHP backend for cPanel deployment.
* **Documentation Strategy:** Adopt the Memory Bank system for comprehensive project documentation from the outset.

## [2025-06-24] - Codebase Analysis and Memory Bank Synchronization

* **Task:** A full analysis of the current codebase was initiated to synchronize the memory bank with the project's actual state.
* **Action:** A `project-research` agent performed a high-level analysis of the architecture, technology stack, directory structure, and key configuration files.
* **Result:** The analysis provided a detailed and up-to-date overview of the project.
* **Status:** **Complete**. The memory bank has been fully updated with the findings from the analysis. `systemPatterns.md` was rewritten, and all other relevant files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `changelog.md`) were appended with new information. The memory bank is now synchronized with the current state of the codebase.

## [2025-06-25] - Error Resolution Session

### Fixes Applied
* **apiService.ts**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors:
  - Fixed `MessageableUser` interface - removed non-existent `avatar_url` property from Pick type
  - Fixed unused `effectivePayload` variable in `adminDeleteSkillAPI` function
  - Fixed unused `payload` parameter in `adminDeleteSkillAPI` function  
  - Fixed unsafe `any` type usage in `fetchAllTimeLogsAPI` function (replaced with `Record<string, string>`)
  - Removed all console.* statements to resolve linting warnings
  - Fixed unused `freelancerId` parameter in `fetchFreelancerJobCardsAPI` function

* **index.tsx**: Fixed incorrect import path for AuthProvider (changed from `./components/AuthContext` to `./contexts/AuthContext`)

### Status
* All TypeScript compilation errors in core files have been resolved
* Build process now completes successfully without errors
* All type checking passes without issues

### Remaining Work
* Some test files may need Jest cache clearing to resolve stale import references
* Consider adding proper error handling/logging instead of removed console statements
* Continue with PHP backend development as outlined in project plan
