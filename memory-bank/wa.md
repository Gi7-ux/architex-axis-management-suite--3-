Be aware of how the menu has expanded while not in the reports section and it expanded on selecting the jobs menu item. 

I filled in a description, but it didn't seem to hold it and it gave me an eroor that it need to be filled out.
2025/05/20, 09:52 - Leor: IMG-20250520-WA0011.jpg (file attached)
I wanted to add another item and it worked nicely to do a number count, but when I pressed the up arrow, the cursor didn't move up to number 1 for me to write. It only moved there when I used the mouse to click there.
2025/05/20, 09:54 - Leor: Weird...I tried typing more again now and it seems to actually be working fine in this regard?

This is semantics, but when I try to create a job for the first time the button for creating the job says "update job". Perhaps it should start by saying "create job". 

As you can see from this screenshot that no jobs were created yet, even though I tried. I don't know what it will look like once a job is created, but a suggestion is to add a button alongside to "edit" and from the editing space of the job another button to be able to push a button to mark it complete and equally a counter function to mark as incomplete in case the job needs to remain open and the complete button was not meant to be pushed. i.e. so that it can be reopened seamlessly from where it was left off.

Another feature within this is that the messaging function needs to be built in to the job cards themselves and not generalise so that the messaging is contextualised.
2025/05/20, 10:10 - Leor: Although, the general messaging option in the menu might also be suitable. But I don't know of this will lead to confusion? What do you think. Have the option to send general messages or only have the option to send contextualised messaged pertinent to specific jobs?
2025/05/20, 10:11 - Leor: On the create job page, there needs to be an upload feature so that any supporting documentation or drawing files can be uploaded.
2025/05/20, 10:14 - Leor: IMG-20250520-WA0013.jpg (file attached)

The reporting I would like to see is a s follows, but not limited to:

1. reporting based on categories, such as by freelancer, by job and by client. 
2. The freelancer reporting must be job specific and in context against the other freelancers to judge performance against colleagues.
3. The job reporting must be to determine status, performance, timeline and budget in relation to completeness and timeline.
4. The client reporting must be if the client has more than one job that there is financial reporting around each job and all their jobs, as well as our performance around them, the completeness of the jobs, etc.
5. I like the drop downs for seeing the jobs overviews. This reporting needs to be divisible into jobs and clients, I think. The dashboard of this needs to show "in progress" jobs for easy tracking at a glance (with a hyperlink to the job details and progress reporting around it for access to the messaging, files and freelancers working on it) and completed jobs need to be archived into client and job reporting under their respective menus. 
6. I like the general financial reporting. This needs to show overall earnings as well as job specific and as against freelancer specific in terms of money owing and/or paid out with a profit reporting. Also in terms of the freelancer reporting here as a means to judge who our best performers and earners are.

I general, I would like the reporting in terms of jobs statuses and tracking in detail and at a glance to be have a timeline and/or bar graph imagery in terms of percentage completeness, etc.

I like this page, but it seems it's just your example. I presume this will be cleared and shown against actual summaries from activity on the site. I would also like the things to be hyperlinked so that the things can be drilled down into their respective locations on the site for ease of access, etc.

I like this message in case something doesn't work and a user comes across this. But hopefully they don't receive these errors in any case. I just selected the change password without changing it.
2025/05/20, 10:48 - Leor: I actually tried changing the password from "password" to "Password", but it gave the same error. Please also make the password feature with the ability to see what the password that has been typed.
2025/05/20, 10:48 - Leor: In general, I think we need to add a captcha or similar feature to the website login to prevent bots...

I need to change the name of the platform. The one you chose isn't resonating. Maybe to make it as one word is nice so reads as a platform name, but dividing things up with capital letters. I like the following two options.

1. ArchitexNexus
2. ArchitexConnect
2025/05/20, 11:01 - GMT: What about its original name ... archiconnect?
2025/05/20, 11:01 - GMT: Ok agreed
2025/05/20, 11:02 - Leor: I liked that too tbh. Are the others I've suggested not resonating with you?

On the login page, It appears that you haven't given an option for the freelancer to register their own account and it's just a straight login. Would it make sense to give them this option and then in terms of the control for it, I can sanction them or not on the system as a functioning or not functioning freelancer, which will then limit if they get jobs pushed to them or not.
2025/05/20, 11:11 - Leor: a feature where I can flag freelancers for non performance or other issues might also be helpful. And this function to select them as functioning or not is important, so there is this control. In addition, If I want to give a specific freelancer a job without sending out a message should be a feature too (I suppose this can be done because I will ultimately have the function to assign the work and I can then push a job to a specific person without sending out a notification to all). I didn't pick up this feature to send out a job card notification to all nor for a freelancer to be able to "raise their hand" for the job that subsequently send that notification to me.

Don't give the freelancer the option to delete their account. Your message suggests that it will all be deleted and that they must download their data. I think the data mustn't be deletable by the freelancer and we must have access to it all, including their history. There must be a function to block a freelancer from accessing their account on the admin side though.

I like this feature of disputes. 

Do you think the freelancer should have access to their own reporting function as well? i.e. something limited to what they have done so they can track their own projects and hours?

There's no message formatting menu on this text box like there is in the admin. It is good to have.
2025/05/20, 12:44 - Leor: Also need to have a file upload facility in the job creation page. Maybe we can limit it to 500mb.

The calendar function needs to be my meeting scheduling page linked to my google calendar instead of the first 2 functions. Although, this needs to be somehow linked in calendar event type as an existing client who is registered in the system as opposed to a new client coming from the website.
2025/05/20, 12:50 - Leor: Is this possible?

I'm not sure I want the client to have access to be able to delete their whole account. If they want to be removed, then maybe give them the option to delete but not all traces of them. I.e. I will need their information and past project for my uses and reporting.
2025/05/20, 13:00 - Leor: Please ass a reporting function for the client as well, limited of course to their jobs only.
2025/05/20, 13:01 - Leor: From here down is client profile comments

3. The portfolio "sample project" selector is still sending me back to the residential portfolio. Please try and fix this referencing issue. <This message was edited>

I didn't notice this when viewing the website from my phone. The desktop version of the portfolio page has gone all wonky. It must be top-down grouping and not side-by-side.
2025/05/20, 13:20 - Leor: Reminder: Read through the legal docs to see where to place them in the workflow of the site. I think T&C with privacy policy checkbox before logging in and then a button link to the NDA on the client and freelancer menu (I might need a separate agreement with the freelancer). and before the client wants to start a job, a pop up must come with the agreement to sign it before they can start a job ( only the first time they do it).
2025/05/20, 14:47 - GMT: Huh how's that possible
2025/05/20, 14:48 - Leor: Maybe I typed the wrong password in.

I noticed on the phone version of this, when I select the image, I can't scroll around or zoom the image. So I can't access it on the phone properly as it's either too small to read or when it's zoomed in I can't navigate around the image to read anything properly.
2025/05/20, 16:29 - GMT: Hmmm okay cool, I'll look into it

2025/05/20, 16:30 - GMT: ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy Policy ‚Äì Key Flaws
Overbroad Consent Clause

Issue: Users are deemed to consent to all processing simply by using the website.

Risk: Under POPIA, consent must be informed, specific, and voluntary. Blanket consent clauses can be challenged.

Vague Data Retention Policy

Issue: ‚ÄúWe retain your information only as long as necessary...‚Äù is too generic.

Risk: POPIA requires clearly defined retention periods or criteria for data disposal.

International Transfers Unclear

Issue: Mentions data may be transferred outside South Africa but lacks specific safeguards.

Risk: POPIA mandates that appropriate data protection levels must be ensured for international transfers, including mechanisms like standard contractual clauses.

Limited User Rights Articulation

Issue: Only basic rights like access and correction are noted.

Risk: POPIA provides broader rights, such as objection to processing and data portability. These are not mentioned.

No Information Officer Mentioned

Issue: POPIA requires the appointment of an Information Officer with public contact details. The Privacy Policy only gives a general email.

Risk: Could be non-compliant with Section 55 of POPIA.

‚ö†Ô∏è Terms and Conditions ‚Äì Key Flaws
Unbalanced Limitation of Liability

Issue: The company broadly excludes liability for almost all damages, even if due to system errors.

Risk: This may be unenforceable under South African consumer protection law if it unfairly disadvantages clients.

Inadequate Dispute Resolution Mechanism

Issue: Disputes default to Johannesburg courts without offering negotiation, mediation, or arbitration options first.

Risk: Especially for SME clients, this may not be practical or reasonable, and could deter legal recourse.

Ambiguous Budget Appeal Terms

Issue: The budget adjustment process is informal and lacks structured dispute resolution or timelines.

Risk: This could lead to disagreements over payment that are hard to resolve or enforce.

Freelancer Relationship Not Legally Defined

Issue: Freelancers are heavily involved but the document lacks a legal definition of their contractual or employment status.

Risk: This opens up liability or misclassification issues, especially with regards to vicarious liability and labour law.

Weak Intellectual Property Clauses

Issue: States ‚Äúoriginal owners retain IP‚Äù but lacks specifics on usage rights, license scope, or handling of derivative works.

Risk: Could lead to IP disputes, especially if freelancers create content on behalf of clients.

Monitoring and Oversight Ambiguity

Issue: The admin‚Äôs power to monitor and review all activity is broad and potentially intrusive.

Risk: Could violate user privacy expectations or POPIA if not backed by specific purpose and safeguards.

‚úÖ Recommendations for Improvement:
Update consent mechanisms to include checkboxes or affirmative actions.

Define retention periods more precisely.

Appoint and disclose an Information Officer.

Include user rights beyond access and correction.

Introduce structured escalation steps before legal disputes.

Clarify freelancer roles via a separate contractor agreement.

Expand IP clauses to cover ownership and licensing clearly.

Limit admin oversight to necessary purposes with POPIA-compliant justification.

2025/05/21, 09:59 - Leor: IMG-20250521-WA0014.jpg (file attached)
And then the dashboard is not yet functional and doesn't reflect the jobs. I think the dashboard need to reflect the jobs according to status. statuses being, new job opportunity (with option to view job); active jobs (alongside with client must be the 1. job status like submitted for review, approved, etc, as well as 2. a comment button that alerts to notifications from the specific job); and completed jobs
2025/05/21, 11:19 - GMT: Ya so I need to do the job module on each user group because I made massive changes on the admin user group, just wanted to be sure that it was showing on client, freelancer users
2025/05/21, 19:48 - GMT: Phew.... ok I got a lot of catching uip to do
2025/05/21, 19:52 - Leor: You do indeed have your work cut out for you. Do you think it's realistic to launch 4th June?
2025/05/21, 19:53 - GMT: ya more than enough time, as long as im doing it every night ans some days, it will be more than ready
2025/05/21, 20:54 - GMT: Sorting the theme colours out for the jobs section is quite a task haha, because there are so many sub sections to sub sub sections lol
2025/05/21, 22:08 - GMT: this has been placed under work submissions, must the freelancer have access to this ?
2025/05/22, 07:43 - GMT: Morning  kinda broke the site last night and not realising, so I'm reuploading the site now 5k files left to upload

2025/05/22, 07:50 - Leor: Front end is working though
2025/05/22, 07:51 - GMT: Yes frontend is untouched
2025/05/22, 07:52 - GMT: I'll have the backend up shortly
2025/05/22, 08:19 - Leor: I'm at a circumcision now, so I'll check it laterüòÇ
2025/05/22, 08:30 - GMT: Uhm ok. No problem
2025/05/22, 10:04 - Leor: I just realised an important thing. I just updated a job by adding a description. If I do that, does it push a notification that the job has been updated to all those on the job card?
2025/05/22, 10:05 - GMT: ill check
2025/05/22, 10:20 - Leor: WORKFLOW FOR MESSAGING:

1. Messaging to be linked to a job card
2. When client sends message, all participants to the job card receive the message, including admin and freelancer
3. freelancer can comment back but only the admin sees the message until he selects send approved
4. admin can message freely

MESSAGING FUNCTION:

1. Ability to send screenshot images and other attachments easily that get placed into an archive folder under the job card (these attachments are to be linked to a subfolder under chat thread within the local hosted folder. i.e. local hosted folder called "ArchiAxis" then subfolder called "job X" under which subfolders can be created online and linked locally to categorise the drawings files and other supporting docs as the user sees fit to categorise, and then an automatic subfolder called "chat thread")
2. Messaging to work similar to WhatsApp in conversation style. i.e. a messaging thread is linked to a job card and functioning like a group chat because of multiple participants to a job. So the Job car can be viewed in "WhatsApp" terms as a group.
3. It might be a nice-to-have addition to have a few pertinent emojis like a tick, thumbs up, winky smiley, etc.
2025/05/22, 10:20 - Leor: I can't think of more for now
2025/05/22, 10:22 - Leor: Also to note on the legal docs is that clients aren't allowed to steal freelancers to work for them privately without written agreement and freelancers aren't allowed to do the same. In the business model, I need to include if this happens that we get some kind of recruitment fee out of it.

2025/05/22, 10:33 - GMT: Ya we haven't implemented a time module yet
2025/05/22, 10:33 - GMT: It's just a mock
2025/05/22, 10:34 - Leor: I figured. Maybe make it not a mock with a hyperlink to a page showing all the active jobs with times that are being logged.

Red = Delete project preferences option
Orange = Split contact info into relevant fields: Name and Surname, contact number, email address, company name, address. This domicillium can maybe be pulled from and populated onto the contract or vice versa. with a description as to why we need the information, i.e. for contract purposes
Yellow = Remove industry or just say optional. Industry will probably be important when we open the platform to a wider user base.

It asks me to enter url when I click save profile. I tried a nonsense one first, but the 2nd one is real and it's not saving the profile.

When I remove the url it lets me save the profile, but brings me to this page. I wonder if it's because I place an image there. Also the image for the profile should have a thumbnail preview and a maximum size limt.

This page makes sense but the text options for the job description should be there please. Just a comment here...

When the client posts a job, then admin gets a notification and then the admin must view the job to allocate the hourly rate. When admin posts a job The client needs to receive these new jobs created with a notification when a job is created, changed or updated so that the client can approve. The client must approve it from the job card page with an approve button and that can update the status automatically. The approval function on the admin status drop down side must be linked to updating the status and when the client pushes the "approve project" button on their side it equally updates the same status but with a notification sent out to admin of being approved.

yellow = Menu goes wonky when I select messages.
red = the messages must populate here automatically titled along with a job card. when a job card is selected the client can be hyperlinked to the messaging thread for that particular job. No option must be given to delete the chat...only a message button, which will open up the chat thread and history.

I'm a little skeptical about this page. It looks scary if I were a freelancer. Do we need this function? Can it not be linked to admin only so that it can be addressed directly between admin and freelancer. I.e. if a client has an issue with a project, it can get logged under disputes, but only for admin eyes.
2025/05/22, 12:28 - Leor: Once selected on the hyperlinks, the job card function for the freelancer needs to have the project details with the option for the freelancer to accept the job or reject it. An hourly rate for the job needs to be set by the admin for the freelancer and a different rate to be set by the admin for the client (this must be from the edit job page of admin). On the edit/create job page from admin, the admin must also have a selector to choose a freelancer as well as what he already has to select the client.
2025/05/22, 12:31 - Leor: On creating a job, once it is in approval status by the client or admin, an option needs to come up to either select a freelancer or post job to a group of freelancers or a post job to all freelancers, which then needs to go to all relevant freelancer notifications so that they can bid to do the job. To bid, they can choose to work at a lower rate than what admin sets it at.
2025/05/22, 12:33 - Leor: This brings into question the assignment function and functionality in terms of is it necessary or what functionality does it have and how do they talk to each other.
2025/05/22, 12:33 - Leor: I will send a screenshot of the page I mean...
2025/05/22, 12:40 - Leor: IMG-20250522-WA0036.jpg (file attached)
assign to freelancer and/or a button to say post job, which brings up a page that has the freelancer list (this list must show details about the freelancer in terms of hours logged on the system, if they are currently busy with a project and what their skill set is and experience or something at a glance (this then means when the freelancer is creating a profile it needs to have a space to write about their experience, which can be preset options, and what their profile details have must populate this freelancer list at a glance). There must be a filter option against categories, i.e. select those who are not busy on a project, select those working on project against various statuses of the projects they are working on, etc. There must be a check box on the left from where to choose which freelancer gets the job posted to who and a check box above the check boxes to select all freelancers to post the job to. And then finally a post job button to send out the notification of the job for the freelancers to raise their hand or bid for the job. The job card status on the admin side needs to have a place to see who has made a bid and under what rate and from there can select who has been assigned the job.
2025/05/22, 12:48 - Leor: I think this can function and communicate against who lands up being selected to be able to assign additional tasks not already defined if things change on the job and is can also function to assign different jobs within the scope to another freelancer. e.g. one freelancer can be chosen to survey a building, while another freelancer can be chosen to model the building in revit, while a third freelancer can be selected to do the actual council drawings, etc.
2025/05/22, 12:49 - Leor: this is only for flexibility. Then the job posting section needs to also be broken down into assignment items under a job if it helps with efficiencies on any job <This message was edited>

I didn't see these notifications. I went into messages and saw these..
2025/05/22, 13:10 - Leor: IMG-20250522-WA0038.jpg (file attached)
When I select reply to a specific message it brings up the "create new message" page instead of the message thread to be able to reply. Either way and as requested above, the messages need to be linked to job cards. We should also have a general messaging aspect to the messaging system if for any reason there is a need to chat about general items or job specific administrative issues. In this case, the freelancer can message the admin and write an admin style message where he can select which job it is in reference to and can ask things like, "when will I be paid", or whatever, etc. freelancer doesn't have to even select which job it is i.r.o. and can create a new chat based on whatever subject (but this can be a general message functionality that is not linked to job cards for dealing with administrative issues - almost like how the messaging function works now). The messaging from client to architect must remain strictly in relation to job card conversations in their respective WhatsApp-group-style chats.

2025/05/22, 22:39 - Leor: Will this app be optimised for cellphones?
2025/05/22, 23:11 - Leor: What are these?

2025/05/23, 06:17 - Leor: Interesting. So the app would be the cellphone version?
2025/05/23, 08:16 - GMT: Yes that's correct
2025/05/23, 08:19 - Leor: So this is actually needed. What's the workflow? Get the desktop app working 100s and then tell ai to turn it into a cellphone app?
2025/05/23, 08:21 - GMT: Something to that effect,  it's slightly more complicated than that haha
2025/05/23, 08:23 - Leor: I'm sure it will take a lot of tweaking to get the ui right.

Red: This profile pic seems random and I can't edit it on the profile page. I really liked the silhouetted bird like it was before.

Orange: This doesn't hyperlink to the create a job page.

Yellow: I added a project and recent activity didn't update. I don't know if the activity that is up here is real or just an example and it's not working yet against the "real world". When we commission this platform, it will need to all be blank like you did before in order to start afresh. 

Generally: this platform iteration looks very different to the previous one. In principal it's nice, but for future iterations as they come up, let's resolve to keep an aesthetic and stick with it. The way the system works now and looks is different from before. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's almost like a different take against comments that weren't made....if you know what I mean? i.e. don't fix it if it aint broke.
2025/06/15, 11:18 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0005.jpg (file attached)
Red: Menu is different to what it was before. Overview is now changed from dashboard. Please revert it to dashboard so that it's more intuitive and consistent.

Orange: I see the chats here are grouped nicely. It's a general chat page, but each project chat is linked to a project and with the client. I will check how this works in relation to the freelancer participation in the chat. BUT...What I notice is that when I select a chat, it makes the top of the chat scroll down to the top of the page as opposed to the top of the whole chat window. i.e. the whole chat window includes the project chat title and that moves away from view, which I think needs to remain in view so that there is constant visual reminder of which chat it is.

Yellow: read the chat...LOL
2025/06/15, 11:20 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0006.jpg (file attached)
This is what I must see in reference to my previous "orange" comment as opposed to what is seen in the previous screenshot, which hides the relevant project chat.
2025/06/15, 11:26 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0007.jpg (file attached)
Red: I added this project. Is the client who I assigned the main client profile? If it is, this project did not pull across to the client profile. If not, then, which profile is the client one so that I can check that this worked. I also see once again that this project did not update on the dashboard as stated in my first comment.

Orange: These action icons need to have a mouse over text and/or a description with "actions" to describe what they are. I clicked away and then I saw the project disappear when I selected the archive button. I didn't know what that was (although I intuitively knew what the others are). At least I was able to unarchive it.

When I select edit project from the project page, I land here. This is good and well, but there is no edit feature to actually edit the project here.
2025/06/15, 11:30 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0009.jpg (file attached)
This works nicely, but each job card needs to have a due date calendar integrated, so that individual tasks can be scheduled and reported against.
2025/06/15, 11:31 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0010.jpg (file attached)
We need to be able to upload project files from this page.
2025/06/15, 11:36 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0011.jpg (file attached)
Is this just a reporting page? An important feature to add is that the admin also gets involved in a project to be able log hours in terms of checking the drawings and whatever other tasks that may be required and can be billable towards each project. i.e. the admin should either have access to this by the admin being able to assign a job card/task to itself (remember to keep the language consistent when naming things, i.e. it must either be a job card or a task and not both).
2025/06/15, 11:39 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0012.jpg (file attached)
When I select to view the project, this window comes up. When I select "manage tasks" it takes me to the home page of the individual project page. It should rather take me to the task page.

Please also add an edit job button next to the manage tasks button.
2025/06/15, 11:41 - Leor: I also can't change the status of the project. i.e. the change project status will presumably fall under the edit project...
2025/06/15, 11:42 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0013.jpg (file attached)
This is what the edit project should also look like so that details can be changed. I also need to be able to assign a freelancer from here.
2025/06/15, 11:47 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0014.jpg (file attached)
This is a general approval feature (once again not labelled as such). Once selected , it cannot be undone. Please allow it to be undone and the approval of it available from the project page and view project screen.
2025/06/15, 11:47 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0015.jpg (file attached)
Also need to be able to change a project status from this page?
2025/06/15, 11:49 - Leor: I see I can delete a project successfully, but I can undo it. We need to have a deleted project page like we have an archived project page so that it too can be undeleted and have a feature to permanent delete the project thereafter.
2025/06/15, 11:54 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0016.jpg (file attached)
Red: It appears that all the pages have this extra space with no apparent reason. It doesn't show info or anything and just seems like extra page. Please remove it.

Orange: This time log filter page is not filtering. i.e. the information below seems to be an example placeholder and not a reflection on the actual times logged, etc. 

Yellow: page is good but generally not working yet. I presume you are aware of this.
2025/06/15, 11:59 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0017.jpg (file attached)
I created a user, but he doesn't have a user account that pulls through as a freelancer, etc. I should be able to create a password for the user and that they should be able to change it. Maybe it should have an automatic password generator and once the user is created it should send an email to the user with their password and the ability to hyperlink from their email to login and change their password and profile, etc.

Gregstein doesn't have a profile he can access.
2025/06/15, 12:05 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0019.jpg (file attached)
User was edited on the admin side and it didn't pull through in the freelancer side.
2025/06/15, 12:06 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0020.jpg (file attached)
I Shift+F5 refreshed this page and details didn't change and then I also logged out and re-logged in and the detail change still didn't pull through.
2025/06/15, 12:06 - Leor: Should admin even have this kind of control?
2025/06/15, 12:08 - Leor: I also deleted Gregstein and now I can't undo this. The delete function in general needs to have a protection and go to a deletion page/recycle bin from where permanent deletion can take place or a restoration.
2025/06/15, 12:11 - Leor: A key feature that is not available from here is the selecting of a freelancer for the task. Once this feature is made available it obviously needs to pull through to the freelancer profile where they can accept, reject, comment on, etc.
2025/06/15, 12:16 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0021.jpg (file attached)
Nice functionality for an open status of a project. I went onto the freelancer profile to apply for this job because I saw it was available and I tried to apply for it. The information didn't pull through. Also, we need to integrate a closing bid date for applying to do a project so that project automatically disappear after closing date and/or this date can be edited and extended if need be.
2025/06/15, 12:20 - Leor: I presume tasks are limited to the freelancer selected for the job? We need to have an option to assign more than one freelancer to a job, this means to be able to assign a task within this page to another freelancer. e.g. once guy will measure a building, while the main assignee will do the drawings. And then another task can be added with a time allocation for the admin to check the work done (Unless in each job, an automatic task gets created for admin to log time for checking? and also checking can be assigned to other freelancers?
2025/06/15, 12:22 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0022.jpg (file attached)
I assigned this job as admin to Bob and it still shows here as open. It should change to show that it's been accepted by another freelancer and then be archived as such on the freelancer side (maybe?)
2025/06/15, 12:24 - Leor: General comment: it appears that the functionality for information to be integrated between and pulling across to the various profiles linked to jobs, tasks messaging, etc are not yet working like it was before.

2025/06/15, 13:09 - Leor: Nothing is pulling through between the profiles, so it's not working. The profiles seem isolated to their own use case and not reflecting between profiles. <This message was edited>

I did a ctr+F5 refresh and all the new information I created disappeared. I created test projects, but they are no longer available with a full refresh. Something is not holding...
2025/06/15, 13:17 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0027.jpg (file attached)
On the freelancer page, This comes up after I make the application, but when I do a full refresh it disappears. All edits and changes I make here and with admin don't stick. They reflect in a session, but then disappear with a new one.
2025/06/15, 13:17 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0028.jpg (file attached)
Same freelancer page after a full refresh...
2025/06/15, 13:23 - Leor: I went into the client profile to check on things there in terms of the same issue. I see there is no functionality for a client to create a job. I think this is quite an important feature to have that we had with the previous iteration. Also, if I edit the profile on all and then do a full refresh, the changes made stay intact. But, when I log out an in again those changes revert back to the "template". <This message was edited>

This is all of a sudden a new font added to the mix. Let's keep things aligned with the front end website for a congruent and unilateral experience.
2025/06/15, 13:38 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0030.jpg (file attached)
admin profile dashboard/landing page. There is something funky going on with the files uploaded section. I understand that this is a dummy section for demonstration purposes?
2025/06/15, 13:39 - Leor: Also, Why is "projects in progress" always highlighted yellow?
2025/06/15, 13:43 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0031.jpg (file attached)
I created a new admin user and I see that admin users cannot be deleted. They should be able to be deleted...except of course the super-admin.
2025/06/15, 13:44 - Leor: and now once again a full refresh removes the new user I just created. I think I said this before that an email should be sent to the new user that has been created in order to access, activate and edit their profile.
2025/06/15, 13:45 - Leor: this will also come with the sign up feature once implemented...
2025/06/15, 13:47 - Leor: IMG-20250615-WA0032.jpg (file attached)
I see in the messaging app you given the message approval functions. But as you may know that these are not yet working.
2025/06/15, 15:49 - GMT: this is purely because I haven't linked it live to a database yet <This message was edited>
