**Purpose**:  
Architex Axis Management Suite exists to streamline project management and time tracking for various stakeholders including administrators, clients, and freelancers. It aims to centralize operations and communications in a single platform.

**Problems Solved**:

**User Experience Goals**:  
- Intuitive and role-specific dashboards for easy navigation and task management.
- Seamless interaction between users of different roles for project updates and communications.
- Clear visibility into project progress and time logs for accountability and transparency.

**How It Should Work**:  
- Users log in and are directed to their role-specific dashboard (Admin, Client, Freelancer).

- Notifications and messaging facilitate real-time updates and collaboration.
