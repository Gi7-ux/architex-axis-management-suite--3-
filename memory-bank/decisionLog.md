[2025-06-22 23:10:39] - **Debugging Strategy**
- **Decision:** Address the large number of Jest and TypeScript errors by tackling them file by file, starting with the most critical and cascading failures. The initial focus was on `FreelancerTimeTrackingPage.test.tsx` due to the `undefined` errors which were blocking other tests.
- **Rationale:** A systematic, file-by-file approach allows for focused debugging and prevents getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of errors. Fixing the most critical errors first can often resolve dependent errors in other files.
- **Implications:** This approach may take longer than a scattered approach, but it is more thorough and ensures that all errors in a file are addressed before moving on.
[2025-06-22 23:11:37] - **Correction: Appending to Memory Bank**
- **Decision:** The user indicated that I should not overwrite the Memory Bank files. I will now append to the files instead.
- **Rationale:** Appending to the files preserves the history of the project and allows for a more complete understanding of the project's evolution.
- **Implications:** This will result in larger Memory Bank files, but it will also provide a more complete context for future work.

[2025-06-23 02:12:02] - **Testing Strategy**
- **Decision:** Run tests serially to avoid out-of-memory errors.
- **Rationale:** Running tests in parallel was causing the test runner to crash. Running them serially, while slower, is more stable.
