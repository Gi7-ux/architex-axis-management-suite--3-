[2025-06-22 23:10:39] - **Debugging Strategy**

- **Decision:** Address the large number of Jest and TypeScript errors by tackling them file by file, starting with the most critical and cascading failures. The initial focus was on `FreelancerTimeTrackingPage.test.tsx` due to the `undefined` errors which were blocking other tests.
- **Rationale:** A systematic, file-by-file approach allows for focused debugging and prevents getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of errors. Fixing the most critical errors first can often resolve dependent errors in other files.
- **Implications:** This approach may take longer than a scattered approach, but it is more thorough and ensures that all errors in a file are addressed before moving on.
[2025-06-22 23:11:37] - **Correction: Appending to Memory Bank**
- **Decision:** The user indicated that I should not overwrite the Memory Bank files. I will now append to the files instead.
- **Rationale:** Appending to the files preserves the history of the project and allows for a more complete understanding of the project's evolution.
- **Implications:** This will result in larger Memory Bank files, but it will also provide a more complete context for future work.

[2025-06-23 02:12:02] - **Testing Strategy**

- **Decision:** Run tests serially to avoid out-of-memory errors.
- **Rationale:** Running tests in parallel was causing the test runner to crash. Running them serially, while slower, is more stable.

[2025-06-24 01:34:00] - **Codebase Analysis and Memory Bank Synchronization**

- **Decision:** To perform a full analysis of the current codebase and update all memory bank files to reflect the findings.
- **Rationale:** The memory bank was potentially out of sync with the current state of the codebase. A full analysis and update are necessary to ensure that all future work is based on accurate and up-to-date information. This provides a solid foundation for future development and decision-making.
- **Implications:** This action brings the project's documentation in line with the actual implementation, reducing the risk of errors and misunderstandings in future tasks. It also establishes a new baseline for the project's state.

[2025-06-24 02:24:45] - **Product Requirements Document (PRD) Approved**

- **Decision:** The Product Requirements Document (`docs/prd.md`) and its sharded components have been formally approved. The status has been updated from "Draft" to "Approved".
- **Rationale:** The PRD has been reviewed and is now considered the official source of truth for product features and requirements. This provides a stable baseline for development planning and execution.
- **Implications:** The development team can now proceed with creating the product backlog based on the user stories and requirements detailed in the approved PRD. No further changes should be made to the PRD without a formal change request process.

[2025-06-24 03:05:00] - **Merge Conflict Resolution Strategy**

- **Decision:** Resolve merge conflicts by systematically addressing each file, prioritizing backend dependencies and then moving to frontend components. For auto-generated files, `git checkout --theirs` was used. For source code, manual merging and fixing of resulting TypeScript errors was performed.
- **Rationale:** This approach ensures that the codebase is brought to a stable state before proceeding with new feature development. It also minimizes the risk of introducing new bugs during the merge process.
- **Implications:** The codebase is now stable and ready for the next phase of development. The Memory Bank has been updated to reflect the changes.
