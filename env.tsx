// This file previously contained content that was not valid TypeScript
// and appeared to be backend environment variable configurations.
// Frontend environment variables are typically managed via the build process
// (e.g., through .env files recognized by tools like Vite or Create React App)
// and accessed via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.
//
// This file is now a valid empty TypeScript module to resolve the compilation errors
// that were occurring due to its previous content.
//
// If you intended to set environment variables for the frontend:
// 1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (if not already present).
// 2. Add your environment variables there (e.g., REACT_APP_API_KEY=yourkey for CRA, or VITE_API_KEY=yourkey for Vite).
// 3. Access them in your code via `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY` or `process.env.VITE_API_KEY`.
//
// The application's API key usage relies on `process.env.API_KEY` being available,
// which is assumed to be pre-configured in the execution environment as per project guidelines.
// This file (env.tsx) is not the place to define `process.env.API_KEY`.

export {}; // Ensures this is treated as a module
